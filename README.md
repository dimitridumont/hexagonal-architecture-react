### Explications
The hexagonal architecture, or architecture based on ports and adapters, is an architectural pattern used in the field of software design. It aims to create systems based on application components which are loosely coupled and which can be easily connected to their software environment by means of ports and adapters. These components are modular and interchangeable, which reinforces the consistency of processing and facilitates the automation of tests.
